This is a pythonic wrapper around the libdc1394 Version 2 for FireWire Cameras.
(http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/libdc1394/) 

This work was primarily developped by Holger Rapp; I use this at work to do
freaky things (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O4FrRujlII) and I consider it
usable though maybe not bug free. 

Included is also a UI (using wxPython and PyOpenGL, you will need these
obviously) called LiveCameraDisplay which takes an opened cameras in init and
displays it's data live. 

Usage
=====

There is an example script included. Basically there are two camera modes. The
first one acquires a number of pictures continuously (e.g. it is guaranteed
that no frames are missing when continously calling Camera.shot(). The other
mode is freerunning, the current image can always be accessed (thread safe) via
Camera.current_image. This mode is useful for visualisation or if you are not
interested in exact timings.  

Synchronized Cams
=================

Point Grey Research offers for their camera an auto synchronization when they
are attached to the same IEEE 1394 Bus. The SynchronizedCams Wrapper class
takes two cameras that need to be opened with the same framerate and mode.
SynchronizedCams.shot will then deliver two pictures taken at the same time.
