	Processing the conversions.h to the library. There are a couple useful
	things in here, which were missing so far. For example to use RGB
	displays, these can help converting any image buffers to RGB8 formats.
	I would suggest them implemented into the Image class.

	Adding new enums:
		bayer_method_t
		stereo_method_t
		
	Now all the files: dc1394/*.h are added. The special functions for the
	specific camera vendors and linux platform are skipped. Sometime they may
	come, but at the moment I think this much is enough for a start.

	All variable names are shortened by removing the dc1394 tag. If one wants,
	still can do:
	
	import _dc1394core as dc1394
	and use everything with dc1394.video_frame_t or similar.

	Shutter, converting to ms: this is only meaningful if the camera is
	absolute capable. Otherwise this is just a number, but the camera manual
	may provide some conversion to it. The multiplication would only
	complicate life in such a case.

	Followed up the changes induced by the ones made in the core library. Now
	it seems the system runs, the camera can take shots, and the basic
	functionality did not change. For some reason I had some problems with the
	_dtype part of the Camera class. I added an inocent declaration to the
	__init__ function, and it runs fine.
	In FORMAT7 mode now the camera mode changes to (0,0, FORMAT7_...), because
	the real shape strongly depends on the ROI and the camera. Anyway the
	current program_format7_mode takes care of setting the shape parameter
	properly.
